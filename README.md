# Installation

## Getting it running on Mac

Outline

* You need a running emulator
* Start the local server (required?) `npm run start`
* Run the app (automatically starting emulator) `npm run ios`

Issues

* `Icon.loadFont()` needed when loading icons.
* Clearing previous builds needed when re-building app.
* See how to build directly to an iPhone device
