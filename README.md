# Installation

## Getting it running on Mac

Outline

* You need a running emulator
* Start the local server (required?) `npm run start`
* Run the app (automatically starting emulator) `npm run ios`

Next steps

* Make sure the icons render correctly (is `Icon.loadFont();` the solution?)
* See how to build directly to an iPhone device
